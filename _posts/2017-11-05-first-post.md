I strongly believe in the importance of scientific discussion, especially between those outside one's specific subfield of expertise. It is here where ideas are most open to creative criticism and fresh perspectives. There is currently no venue for structured live (e.g., using microphones) discussions between researchers in the fields of Neuroscience and Psychology.

OnNeuro plans to meet biweekly early next year as a place to discuss new articles and discoveries in the field. Please sign up to be informed of our first meet-up, and feel free to join our <src = https://discord.gg/rAh5xMY> Discord </src> to chat now with eager researchers. We thank you for your interest, and please email to let us know any ideas or comments you have about OnNeuro!
