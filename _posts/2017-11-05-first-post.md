While there are already venues like online forums to allow for discussions between researchers across the world, there is currently no site for structured live (e.g., using microphones) discussions. I strongly believe in the importance of not only easily-shared ideas between researchers, but also ease of access to public scientific discussions. OnNeuro will launch early next year and be a venue for biweekly live discussions regarding new articles and developments in the fields of psychology and neuroscience.

If you are a researcher, this is your chance to spread your current work to a wider audience and to chat with other members of the scientific community! If you are not a researcher, this is a unique chance to listen/speak with scientists paving the way for research. Note that by taking part in our live discussion you are consenting to having a recorded tape of the meeting made publicly available.

Please [sign up](https://goo.gl/forms/vOhmWPAmmTMuXAxj2) to be informed of our first meet-up, and feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rAh5xMY). We thank you for your interest, and please [email](onneuro@gmail.com) to let us know any ideas or comments you have about OnNeuro!
