OnNeuro is set to meet once a month on Discord. At the start of the month, an email will be sent out to everyone on the [mailing list](https://goo.gl/forms/vOhmWPAmmTMuXAxj2) that contains a time and date for when to meet. The email will state whether the discussion will be on a particular research article or if it will consist of a researcher presenting their work. We encourage listeners to interject at any time during the meeting via text- or voice-chat with any questions or comments.

__Useful Information To Know:__
1. Discussions will take place over [Discord](https://discord.gg/zmAAx2W) (text or voice-chat only). 
    * It takes 30 seconds to join and doesn't require downloading or registering a new account -- just follow this [handy-dandy guide](https://onneuro.github.io/ImageAssets/DiscordInstruct.png).
2. Discussions may consist of:
    1. Discussion of an article, or
    2. Presenting original research 
        * If the meeting is based on a research study, prior reading of the article (or at least skimming the article) is expected.
3. Discussions will be led by an individual presenter who will provide others with a powerpoint to follow along. 
    * Meetings have no set length, and duration may vary depending on the topic and amount of discussion. It is fine to join and leave at any time (but note that joining late may mean you get confused as to what is happening). 
4. Meetings will be recorded for later listening. 
    * This is so people can still listen to the discussion despite not being available at the scheduled time.

**Please email onneuro@gmail.com if you would like to lead a future discussion** (either article discussion or presentation of your own research) or if you simply wish to suggest an article or topic for discussion.
